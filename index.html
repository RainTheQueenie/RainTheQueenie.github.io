(intro)
i am a nobody a no one.(softly)
(pause)
i am a nobody a no one.(louder)
(exhale) (pause)
i am a nobody a no one. nobody knows what im thinking or doing.(bit louder)
Nobody knows who i am not even i.

(Verse)
the things i say are just a masquerade. do you hear me or just what i say check each line its more then just a rhyme.
but dont be afraid because nobody no one at all. but yet here we all are sitting alone behind the same doors.
doors wide open but we will never enter them because we are all alone. alone and afraid.
i am a nobody no one at all. so dont pay me any mind. they might as well be blind. i show them the truth but they ask me whats wrong.

(Chorus)
Sad troopers
we are all just some sad troopers(softly)
sad troopers
we are all just some sad troopers(louder)
sad troopers
</p></center>

(Bridge)
we are all just some sad troopers walking around this mad mad world staying alive just to die.
but there isn't much i can do about that so i will keep on marching with my sad troops behind me.
if the human life is really more valuable then ever before why is everyone so sad.
